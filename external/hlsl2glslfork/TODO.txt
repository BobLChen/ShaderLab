Very rough list of to do items:

* Cleanup AST structures and expose them (would like to use in Unity's surface shader analysis)
* Full support for integer types & ops (emit as EXT_gpu_shader4)
* Output of existing feature set into GLSL ES 3.00 syntax
* Parse DX10+ HLSL; object types, template-like stuff etc.
* Output into GLSL 3.20+
* Translate geometry shaders
* Translate hull & domain shaders
* Translate compute shaders
